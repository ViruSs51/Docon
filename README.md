# Docon

This project allows you to create files containing folders for different individuals - you indicate the information yourself (future updates will include internet search systems).

Docon can be used both through the terminal and through the interface.
## Security

Data security is built from scratch following my concept. Docon encrypts all data in such a way that the password is not saved anywhere, only in the user's mind - making it impossible to bypass security.

The only drawback to this security lies in the fact that the password is quite long, and making it shorter is not possible. Therefore, this product is not suitable for a large user base as it is not very convenient.
## Development

**New**

- The project structure has been created at the beginning to facilitate further development.
